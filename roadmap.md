# Planning Poker

## Vision

The planning poker application has been built
to better facility planning and project managment
within our (the authors of this service) team at
[OpenStax](http://openstax.org);
and specifically for the
[CNX team](https://cnx.org/about/people).

The application is used to better facilitate project/agile-sprint planning
among remote team members by providing an interface
for which estimation of work
can be done in a realtime colaborative environment.
The assumption is that this application is used in conjunction with
a voice communication medium (e.g. Skype).

The application will aid in tracking a teams progress/performance.
This will give the team members a feeling of fulfilled when the sprint
is completed (i.e. all tasks have had their exit criteria met)
within the estimatated time frame,
With proper estimates,
the team will provide better work timelines for management,
while also allowing work to remain relaxed and fun.
As a result, better quality and more accurate implemenation will result,
team members will be further motivated, and productively will increase.

This project uses technologies used within our project stack,
which makes it easier to modify as our feature needs expand.
The use of existing technolgies will
make feature development easier to approach,
faster to implement and enable the ability to experiment.

- *As a* **<role>**,
  *I want* <capability>
  *so that* <value>


- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* to allow my remote (and physically present) team members
  to participate in real-time planning poker 
  *so that* my team can track it's progress, feel fulfilled when the sprint
  is completed within the actual estimate, and provide better work timelines
  for management, while also allowing work to remain relaxed and fun.
  

- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* to be able to identify who the player is within the interface
  *so that* I know 1) who is seated at the poker table
  2) who hasn't played in the hand yet, and
  3) who made the extremely off base estimate.
- *As a* **team member**,
  *I want* to contextually know what it is we are estimating
  *so that* I can make the make the best estimate possible.
- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* the team's poker values to be averaged
  *so that* I don't have to do the maths.
- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* track a planning session's plays
  *so that* I know what cards where used in each hand(/set)
- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* the table to highlight outliers
  *so that* I know who to question regarding the estimate
- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* to invalidate a hand that has more high margin of error
  *so that* we can pause and discuss the problem before playing the hand over.


- *As a* **project manager**
  *I want* graphs showing how accurate estimates are to actual work
  *so that* my team can better plan for
  1) the amount of work that goes into a sprint
  2) the amount of work that can actually be completed within a sprint
  3) where the pain points that block work from being completed according
  to the estimated time
  4) what resources are over/under utilized.
- *As a* **team member**
  *I want* how often my estimates were over/under or spot on
  *so that* I can feel good/bad and/or motivated about the planning process.
- *As a* **team member**
  *I want* badge that shows 100% work completed within a sprint
  *so that* I can feel motivated and empowered to do the same in the next one.
- *As a* **team member**
  *I want* to raise the "you're implementing" flag during discussions
  *so that* I can scope the conversation to planning rather than implementing.
