## Stories

- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* to allow my remote (and physically present) team members
  to participate in real-time planning poker 
  *so that* my team can track it's progress, feel fulfilled when the sprint
  is completed within the actual estimate, and provide better work timelines
  for management, while also allowing work to remain relaxed and fun.
  

- *As a* **project manager**,
  *I want* to be able to identify who the player is within the interface
  *so that* I know 1) who is seated at the poker table
  2) who hasn't played in the hand yet, and
  3) who made the extremely off base estimate.
- *As a* **team member**,
  *I want* to contextually know what it is we are estimating

- *As a* **project manager**,

- *As a* **project manager**
  *I want* graphs showing how accurate estimates are to actual work
  *so that* my team can better plan for
  1) the amount of work that goes into a sprint
  2) the amount of work that can actually be completed within a sprint
  3) where the pain points that block work from being completed according
  to the estimated time
  4) what resources are over/under utilized.
- *As a* **team member**
  *I want* how often my estimates were over/under or spot on
  *so that* I can feel good/bad and/or motivated about the planning process.
- *As a* **team member**
  *I want* badge that shows 100% work completed within a sprint
  *so that* I can feel motivated and empowered to do the same in the next one.
- *As a* **team member**
  *I want* to raise the "you're implementing" flag during discussions
  *so that* I can scope the conversation to planning rather than implementing.
